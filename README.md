# Portfolio
This is my Portfolio site. Created during my spare time using HTML CSS and Javascript (mostly JQuery)

I used several plugins and modules which included:

Bootstrap
SuperSlides
Owl
FancyBox
CountUp
FontAwesome
PieChart
Isotope
Typed

You can view the finished site through this link https://kirizhu.github.io/Portfolio/
